Question 1:  What are the top selling products internationally?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT sk.productsku, al.v2productname, sk.total_ordered
FROM sales_by_sku sk JOIN all_sessions2 al USING (productsku)
GROUP BY sk.productsku, al.v2productname, sk.total_ordered
ORDER BY sk.total_ordered DESC;
```

Answer: 
productsku        v2productname                                  total_ordered
GGOEGOAQ012899    "Ballpoint LED Light Pen"                      456
GGOEGDHC074099    "Google 17oz Stainless Steel Sport Bottle"     334
GGOEGOCB017499    "Leatherette Journal"                          319
GGOEGOCC077999    "Google Spiral Journal with Pen"               290
GGOEGFYQ016599    "Foam Can and Bottle Cooler"                   253
GGOEGFYQ016599    "Koozie Can Kooler"                            253
GGOEGHPJ080310    "Google Blackout Cap"                          189
GGOEADHH073999    "Android 17oz Stainless Steel Sport Bottle"    167
GGOEGAAX0037      "Google Sunglasses"                            146
GGOENEBQ078999    "NestÂ® Cam Outdoor Security Camera - USA"      112


While viewing the whole column, I noticed two things. The top selling product which is the Google Pen, and also the top selling brands, Google and NEST.



Question 2: How much stock is left for the most in demand products?

SQL Queries:
```SQL
SELECT sk.productsku, al.v2productname, sk.total_ordered, sr.stocklevel
FROM sales_by_sku sk JOIN all_sessions2 al USING (productsku)
JOIN sales_report sr USING (productsku)
GROUP BY sk.productsku, al.v2productname, sk.total_ordered, sr.stocklevel
ORDER BY sk.total_ordered DESC;
```

Answer:
While looking at the stock levels, all the top selling products were sufficiently stock.


Question 3: How much visitors that purchased  a product were referred to the site?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT fullvisitorid, channelgrouping, totaltransactionrevenue
FROM all_sessions2
WHERE totaltransactionrevenue IS NOT NULL
AND channelgrouping LIKE 'Referral%'
GROUP BY fullvisitorid, channelgrouping, totaltransactionrevenue
ORDER BY totaltransactionrevenue DESC;
```

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(channelgrouping), SUM(totaltransactionrevenue)
FROM all_sessions2
WHERE channelgrouping LIKE '%Referral%'
```

Answer:
The first query gave us the total amount each visitor purchased when referred to a product while the second query gives us the total count of referrals which is 2580, and the total amount made from referrals, $6010.


Conclusion:

Certain cities and countries are driving significant transaction revenues on the site. We see unique purchasing habits and product preferences based on region, with specific top-sellers emerging for different areas. By leveraging these insights, we can tailor the marketing and inventory strategies, optimizing revenue and growth for each region
